note: follow these instructions and copy/paste commands step by step . bash commands are given below the "bash" word )


Step 1: Reset iptables to Default State

Before proceeding with Snort setup, reset iptables to its default state:

bash:

sudo iptables -F   # Flush all the current rules
sudo iptables -X   # Delete all user-defined chains
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

Step 2: Check Snort Installation

Ensure Snort is correctly installed and configured:

    Open the Snort configuration file to check the interface and network settings.

    bash:

sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.debian.conf

Look for the HOME_NET variable to define the local network:

plaintext

var HOME_NET [192.168.1.0/24]

Check if Snort is running:

bash:

ps -A | grep snort

If it isn’t running, start it:

bash:

    sudo systemctl start snort

Step 3: Configure Snort Command

Set up Snort to run in the background and monitor traffic:

bash:

sudo snort -m 027 -D -d -l /var/log/snort -u snort -g snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -S HOME_NET=[192.168.1.0/24] -i <network_interface>

Replace <network_interface> with the correct interface name (you can find this using ifconfig or ip a).
Step 4: Add Test Rules

    Disable Interfering Rules: Disable icmp-info.rules in the Snort configuration file.

    bash:

sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf

Comment out the line that includes the icmp-info.rules:

plaintext

#include $RULE_PATH/icmp-info.rules

Enable Full Alerts Logging:

Turn on full alert logging in snort.conf:

plaintext

output alert_full: snort.alert_full

Create a Local Rules File: Open or create local.rules.

bash:

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Add the following rule (replace <UbuntuIP> with your Ubuntu machine’s IP address):

plaintext

    alert icmp any any -> <UbuntuIP> any (msg:"ICMP Packet found"; sid:10000001;)

Step 5: Restart Snort and Test

    Restart Snort:

    bash:

sudo systemctl restart snort

Test the ICMP Rule: Use a ping command from your Windows 10 VM to send ICMP packets to your Ubuntu VM:

bash:

ping <UbuntuIP>

Check Snort Alerts:

Check if Snort has logged the alerts:

bash:

    u2spewfoo /var/log/snort/snort.alert
    less /var/log/snort/snort.alert_full

Step 6: Modify Rule for Bidirectional Traffic

Change the ICMP rule to capture bidirectional traffic:

    Edit the local.rules:

    bash:

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Modify the ICMP rule as follows:

plaintext

alert icmp any any <> 192.168.1.21 any (msg:"ICMP Packet found"; sid:10000001;)

Restart Snort again:

bash:

    sudo systemctl restart snort

    Test with pings again and check the logs.

Step 7: Add Additional Rules for Specific Ports

Add rules to detect FTP and HTTP traffic:

    Edit the local.rules file again:

    bash:

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Add the following lines:

plaintext

alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"FTP Packet found"; sid:10000002;)
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"HTTP Packet found"; sid:10000003;)

Restart Snort:

bash:

    sudo systemctl restart snort

    Test FTP: Use an FTP client or web browser to generate FTP and HTTP traffic and check Snort logs for alerts.

Step 8: Testing with Known Malware Samples

Download Malware Samples:

    Download teardrop.cap:

    bash:

wget https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures/teardrop.cap -P ~/Downloads

Run Snort against the capture file:

bash:

sudo snort -qvde -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l /var/log/snort -r ~/Downloads/teardrop.cap -K ascii

Check the output for detected attacks.

Download eternalblue-success-unpatched-win7.pcap:

bash:

wget https://www.netresec.com/index.ashx?page=pcapfiles -P ~/Downloads

Run Snort on this file as well:

bash:

    sudo snort -qvde -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l /var/log/snort -r ~/Downloads/eternalblue-success-unpatched-win7.pcap -K ascii

Step 9: Update Snort Rules

If you need the latest Snort rules:

    Download the community rules:

    bash:

wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/community/community-rules.tar.gz -P ~/Downloads

Extract the rules:

bash:

tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/community-rules.tar.gz -C /etc/snort/rules/

Update your snort.conf to include the new rules.

Restart Snort:

bash:

    sudo systemctl restart snort

Step 10: Finally its done
